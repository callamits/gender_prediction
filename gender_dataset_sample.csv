"men in his late 20s
üëã hey there, now i am entering in my late 20s what are the new skills or anything you have developed that have a major impact in your life.
Please keep the discussion free and civil. Any violation of the subreddit rules in this space will be met with action from the moderators.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.
I am in my late 20s as well. These are some of the skills I could develop. I learnt to make sketches with pen, somewhat improved upon my social skills (I was more of an introvert previously), learnt making memes and making educational posts online and this helped me connect with many similar people online (we created a research group on platforms like discord, instagram, and I could collaborate with people of different continents).
Being confident and upfront when talking to someone you fancy. Games and signs are for children.
Just turned 26. Don't know if I qualify as late 20s. But the notable thing I developed recently is work-life balance. Cz I loved my work and was becoming a workaholic to an extent. Realised that I cannot sustain love for my work if I continue like this. Started socialising, working out and hanging out with friend. Now I do have a balanced situation in life, at least for now.
I'm struggling with becoming a workaholic too. It's certainly better than it was a few months ago where my work-life balance was practically nonexistent and I realized I would burn out hardly a year into my career if I kept going that way. Working out has helped me tremendously with mental clarity and just feeling better each day, but socializing outside of university and old friends is still a struggle lol.
Learn to say no, and communicate boundaries/discomfort clearly, no matter who is on the other side.
Time management and Organization, as you grow older, the time in a day seems to shrink with so many things to do in parallel, a sorted head keeps it going well.
Anger management or more like Emotion management, you may have a rush of emotions at times, which is pretty normal and human, express, deal, and process in your own way, but do not slide it under the rug, that is an unhealthy practice, small tricks save a lot of trouble when it comes to this.
Donate old clothes and shoes every now and then. It is normal to have a few ones that you hardly use, you just don't need them, so give them off to someone in need.
If something bothers you, if something gives your conscience any kind of trouble, deal with it, clearer your conscience is, peaceful your head will be!
It goes without saying that you should be knowing a lot of essential skills, from cooking to sweeping to mopping to basic sewing to laundry to anything that might be needed in a situation if in case you are stuck somewhere alone. Lockdowns taught a lot of people the need for this the hard way.
About learning? Whatever fascinates you even a little bit, try to learn that, at least put 100% effort into learning and see if the excitement fades away or goes stronger. These little things/skills are your friend that calm you down at times.
Hey i saw you have great writing skills, conveying small things in a great manner i will say, i really need this kind of skills both in verbal as well in communication that hooked the users (only the drug dealers called their people, users). Impress by your writing skills bro. Kudos to you
Realized that I can't do anything good without any external help. Be it people or environment both matters. Skills? I can make upama, poha, tea for breakfast.
Cooking
Taking care mental health
Fitness
If you never focused on your looks, please do it before you losing your youth.
""It's an insult not to see beauty of a body"" - internet
Never had a relationship or friends with opposite gender try now.
These all are, what I am trying now

"Any of you guys go back to uni in your late 20's for a bachelor's degree?
I'm 28 and going to go back to uni to complete a major in computer science. My main concern though is if it would be weird being the old guy. I get that lots of people are going back to school, but I'm just wondering if any of you have done that and if it felt weird or not? Were you guys able to make friends? Was it tough connecting with the younger crowd? Did it feel like you were regressing in life?
I went ""back"" when I left the military. I was 26 or 27 at the time. It's no weirder than you choose it to be. I had a good time, and I doubt most people knew or cared about the (reasonably small) age gap between us.
I think the challenge will be more on you than on them. You'll quickly realize that a lot of 18-19 year olds are really fucking dumb, and can be pretty damn annoying at times. If you can suffer through that, you'll be fine ;)
I went to uni from age 24-27 and it was fine. I was actually quite popular with the girls...I guess it was that whole ""older, more mature"" thing. edit: I remember one of the girls I hooked up with telling me a group of them had a conversation about me, and the repeated saying was ""there's just something about him"". ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
There was a guy in my program that was like 40. There were certainly a lot of people that thought he was weird/it was weird that he was getting a bachelors.
So there's a line somewhere that makes it weird. It's somewhere above 24 and somewhere below 40.
Yeah. Lots of old farts in r/cscareerquestions.
I went back at 30 myself. Kind of weird I guess? I was way more motivated than 99% of the other people. The only real friend I made was the other hard working guy. I recommended him for an internship and we work at the same company now.
Not really regressing. I went from unemployed/minimum wage to having a job that pays pretty decently and life is good.
I am almost done and I will be 30, most of my other friends that are veterans as well are the same age as me or a bit older (for the most part) it's not too weird to me, but then again I don't treat school like an 18 freshmen chilling in the dorms trying to figure out my way in college/life. I just go here shut my mouth do my work and go home. You should be fine.
Basically what I did when I went back to school. 27 and graduated at 30.
My only frustration was the group projects. I loathe the group projects. I always ended up taking charge because none of the younger students would want to step up.
The same went for speaking in front of the class for presentations. I was an NCO in the military and gave tons of briefings to all levels, and in front of numerous people.
What I noticed was how the other students would be in awe of my public speaking, demeanor, and confidence.
The younger girls would gravitate towards me. Was a lot easier to notice this as I was older but was and am in a committed relationship at the time. Would of been interesting not to be in one but I digress.
Overall, it was wealth worth it to finish my degree cause I have a great career. Not job.
I am in exactly this situation right now. I got my masters in medical physics, and the job market in that sector managed to tank right around the time I graduated. After spending a year looking for work I got sick of it and went back to do a CS major part time.
It's fine, really. Most people don't even realise I'm so much older than them.
I knew a guy who was like 45, probably, who was in our program. I don't remember exactly why he was there (perhaps got laid off or was taking a break or something), but it wasn't at all a big deal. I think he might've felt out of place at times, but I really think it was more from his perspective than anyone else's.
I admired him.
I studied in night classes before and half the class are already working people. Quite often these 30 years olds in suits are slower in memorising special terms or economic models, but always comes up above average with their reports and essays, especially in real life case studies.
Friendwise, they were always active socially. After class, us fresh HS graduates loves to talk to them. I for one, find it cool that even with a decade difference, they do not seem that different to me, except that modt of them are not as impulsive as I am.

"Returning to college in your 30‚Äôs????
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts of returning to college in your 30‚Äôs?? My career recently ended after 14 years in the same field. I‚Äôve decided I don‚Äôt want to continue the same kind of work and am considering going to college. I have a wife, kid, mortgage etc is this really such a good idea at my age? Won‚Äôt I be the ‚Äúold‚Äù guy? Stupid I know.
I finished my undergraduate degree in my 30s. It's a different experience, being there with a specific mission in mind instead of as a way of burning up five years. Having to take certain 100-level courses was the only awkward bit. Once I was wrapping up my major everyone was just focused on the work. In group projects my teammates sort of assumed I was going to be in charge, probably based solely on age,
If you're doing grad school nobody will bat an eye, nor at community college or a large university. But I reckon going to a small liberal arts school would be different.
I went back for a B.Ed at 32-and with a 15 month old daughter. Just retired a few years ago-I am 62.
I will give you some thoughts about going back as a mature student that you might find interesting.
You will be closer in age to your instructors and they relate to you easier than a younger student. I really noticed this when there was a snafu in my transfer of grades from a different institution. Most of them had kids and could empathize with my situation.
I worked in landscaping in the summers and same thing. The bosses related much better to me than to the young kids.
Time is most likely going to be the biggest problem. I've got plenty of friends in their 30s who went back to study tertiary ed while working full time and every single one said balancing work, family (if they had one) and study was a lot of work. Some did it better than others but I don't think anybody regretted it. They all seem to be fairly happy they went back to hit the books.
If your time management is shit get on top of that now. Once you have that sorted and the issue of finance or study costs isn't a huge stumbling block then I say go for it if it's something you're really set on.
I went to grad school to change careers at 30. Now I'm 32 and after graduating last month I am about to start working at my dream job. It's hard but I was not the oldest one in the class and it paid off amazingly well. I'm not gonna lie, having student debt in your 30s really fucking sucks, but if it means having a stable career in a stable field with actual power and responsibilities then it is absolutely worth it.
You will not be ""the old guy."" And even if somehow you are, I assure you nobody will tease you or call you stupid. If anything they will admire you and hold you up as an example that you can go back to school no matter what your age is.
I'm going back to school this fall, albeit part time while my job will remain my main occupation, also after a career transition. I don't have any hindsight to share yet because I haven't started but obviously, I don't think it's a dumb idea or weird and I know many other people who did or are doing that.
My partner also did a couple years ago, when he was already 30+. I know he wishes he went earlier (it's his first degree) but better late than never.
ETA: not sure it matters but I'll be studying in one of the humanities departments and my partner went to trade school.
I'm starting a two year robotics degree in September and turning 32 tomorrow. Am gonna have myself a daughter due November. So what if I'm the oldest guy there or not. It feels good to know that it's never to late to start over and make a difference in me, my SO and my future little girls life.
More likely than not the other students are gonna look up to you for having the courage to change your life.
Went back for my Masters in CS which I'm close to finishing now(undergrad in math, 2000-2006). There will probably be some older people there in the same boat especially if you're doing ""continuing ed"" night time classes. It's not weird and it's not a bad idea. IMO unless you have much more important things to be doing school isn't really a bad idea even if you just want to take a class in something specific because you're intellectually curious. It's good for your brain to use it in different ways and work the old muscles you may have relaxed.
I went back to schoolto finish at 27, totally worth it. Since I was footing the bill, I was pretty super focused and did not screw around at all Greatly improved my job outlook. I went to grad school at 34, got out in 2 while working full time and with an infant. Still would recommend.
Went back to community college in my early 30's. Mostly the oldest person in my class, but I was filling out basic credit hours like Psyc 101, English 101, etc. Was kind of interesting being the only person in the English class that knew where a lot of random idioms came from when we covered that.
I'll be turning 34 in a few months. I've just finished the first year on an MA I'm studying from home. I plan to do a Phd afterwards. I don't have what you would call a ""career"". I just go from minimum wage job to minimum wage job. Going back into education will hopefully set me on a different path.
If the average college UG degree is done in 4-5 years, then please ask yourself what else can you do to improve or change your life in those years if you don't go to college.
DO IT! You only spin around the sun in this meat costume once. So, barring any awful upheavals to your household, get your ass into school :-)
That sounds like a whole lot of fun. You'll be the old guy, so what? You know how to actually work at something, you're interested (I assume), and you're in a position to get a lot more out of it by virtue of the fact that you have likely already discovered yourself and established your relationship, if any, with mood-altering drugs.

"30 Books Every Man Should Read By 30
A countdown of the novels you need to call yourself a grown up
In an ascending level of importance, here are 30 must-read books ‚Äì from the likes of Hemingway, Naipaul and Murakami ‚Äì that every man really should have tackled by the time he‚Äôs a grown-up (and why).
Don‚Äôt be too ashamed if you haven‚Äôt made your way through each and every one of them, though. We‚Äôll give you until the end of the week.
As if the fact that A House for Mr Biswas came out in 1961, when its author was only 28, isn‚Äôt remarkable enough, the ambition, humour and perceptiveness in Naipaul‚Äôs landmark novel is, frankly, mind-blowing. Based on Naipaul‚Äôs own father, Mohun Biswas is a Hindu Indian in Trinidad and Tobago, who we follow as he negotiates the slings and arrows of marriage, parenthood and human pettiness (not least his own) ‚Äì and of course good old-fashioned fate ‚Äì in his quest for self-determination. (Oh, and to make matters worse, Naipaul actually started writing it at 25).
Everyone should read at least one Murakami (several, really), and this is up there with the best. Hearing The Beatles song that this novel takes its title from, protagonist Toru dwells upon his student days in the sixties protesting against the status quo. His relationship with the beautiful but damaged Naoko is a lesson that emotional dependence is not love.
Published in 2013, when it won the National Book Critics Circle Fiction Award, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie‚Äôs third novel is ostensibly the tale of high school sweethearts in Nigeria whose paths diverge when they travel to America and Britain to make new lives for themselves, only to reconnect (or not?) years later. But the book‚Äôs fundamental power lies in Adichie‚Äôs pinpoint observations about racial identity in the modern age.
The book that sparked the biggest literary controversy of our time. The fatwa issued because of critical references of the Prophet Mohammed saw Rushie go into hiding for over a decade. This novel looks at a man trapped between Eastern and Western cultures, and flits between times and continents.
You might imagine that getting through Karl Ove Knausgaard‚Äôs six-volume semi-autobiographical novels would be a struggle all of your own, but such is the Norwegian author‚Äôs much lauded style ‚Äìforensically detailed, brutally honest and apparently effortless ‚Äì you‚Äôll find yourself zipping through them in no time. Life, love, sex and death: it's all here. And coffee. Lots of coffee.
The book that launched a million gap years, On The Road is beat poet pioneer Jack Kerouac's freeform account of hedonistic road trip across America in the Fifties that excites you when you're still young enough to grab a backpack and follow him, and frustrates the hell out of you with its pretentiousness thereafter.
Roth was hardly hiding his light under a bushel with his choice of title (albeit slightly sardonically intended), but his Pulitzer-Prize winning novel more than lives up to its billing. His story of Seymour ‚ÄúSwede‚Äù Levov, an exceptionally ordinary ‚Äì or perhaps ordinarily exceptional ‚Äì Jewish-American star-athlete-turned-business-man whose perfect life is derailed by personal tragedy is set out against a backdrop of upheaval in Sixties and Seventies America: violent revolutionary movements, Watergate, the Vietnam War.
What is being in your twenties all about if not going on a road trip with your best friend, buying a huge bag of hallucinogenic drugs and losing your mind in Vegas? OK, so few of us ever came remotely near matching Thompson's hedonism even during our wildest years, but Fear And Loathing remains the definitive way to experience drugs vicariously.
Perhaps the ultimate 'someone understands me!' moment literature has to offer any reasonably sensitive and intelligent teenager, Salinger's idiosyncratic and often hilarious tale of a young man struggling with his sanity in a world of 'phonies' is, like sport, something you either fall for when you're a kid or spend you adult years wondering what all the fuss is about. For the former type, this book still has few equals.
There's a strong case to say all men should read all Hemingway, but as an introduction to his style and major themes (bullfighting, drinking, not knowing what the hell to do about women), this collection of short stories is priceless and should whet the appetite to tackle the major novels (specifically The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell To Arms and For Whom The Bell Tolls ‚Äì in that order).
Along with Animal Farm, 1984 is George Orwell's gift to anyone experiencing their moment of political awakening, a book that drags you from the self-involvement of adolescence to the harrowing realisation that politics and the wider world can and will impact your life. Every important ‚Äì and terrifyingly prophetic ‚Äì reason to be watchful, sceptical and demanding of your government is in there.",male
"The 15 Essential Skills to Master in Your 40s
The definitive checklist for becoming a knowledgeable, dependable, and well-rounded man.
Let's be clear: you don't have to be a licensed mechanic to be able to fix a broken-down car. You needn't be a certified sommelier to pick a great bottle of wine, either. And one thing's for sure: you definitely don't have to be a seasoned standup comedian to tell a good story.
As someone on the cusp of middle age, there are some things in life‚Äîwhether it's applying first-aid at a moment's notice, or simply knowing how to treat a woman‚Äîthat you need to be able to do to be considered a well-rounded, knowledgeable, and dependable man. With that in mind, we've compiled the essential life skills that you need to master right now‚Äîand once you've honed your game, don't miss the 20 Things That Only Men 40 Know.
1
How to Give a Compliment
A great compliment requires a delicate balance: Say too much, and you risk sounding disingenuous. Say too little, and you risk ""damning with faint praise.""
Julienne Derichs, a licensed clinical professional counselor who has spent 22 years working with couples, says that a key to good compliment giving is to ""be genuine.""
""Come from a place of positive energy,"" she says. ""Compliments are a gift that tell another person they are worthy of notice. Taking notice of other people is a powerful social skill that you need to master now that you're in your 40s. It's not all about you any longer."" And don't forget: if you're still on the market, check out our Best Dating Apps for Men 40.

How to Do Basic First Aid
If you saw an accident on the freeway, or a frail old person take a tumble on the sidewalk, would you know what to do? You should. Whether understanding how to dress a wound or help relieve the pain from a second-degree burn, every man needs to be able to treat a wide range of daily injuries‚Äîand be able to act fast. If you don't, sign up for a class through Red Cross to refresh your skills‚Äîand you might end up saving the day.
While you're improving yourself, be sure to read about the Best Ways to Bulletproof Your Immune System.

How to Tell a Story
You don't have to be a brilliant comedian or charismatic actor to hold court at a meeting, wedding, or cocktail party. You should have a handful of fun stories that will entertain both friends and strangers, and know how to calibrate them, depending on the audience and circumstances (yes, you should skip the more ribald stuff at work events). ""The best storytellers look to their own memories and life experiences for ways to illustrate their message,"" writes Carolyn O'Hara in the Harvard Business Review. ""What events in your life make you believe in the idea you are trying to share?""
If you're in search of great firsthand material, here's the 50 Things You Must Do Before You Die.
4
How to Deliver a Speech
Whether you've delivered a few best-man speeches or given a presentation at an industry conference, you should be comfortable in front of a crowd by the time you're in your 40s. Delivering a speech is not much different than telling a story, but with a few key differences: You should have notes in case your mind goes blank, know how to balance a casual tone without losing focus of the point of the speech, and know how to keep your audience engaged. And if you get anxiety over stage fright, learn to fight back with The 5 Biggest Male Stressors‚ÄîConquered.
5
How to Apologize
Now that you are in your 40s, you need to not only be able to admit your error, but also be able to strengthen trust and relationships in the process. ""Learning how to sincerely apologize is an essential social skill that helps to decrease resentment and conflict in most relationships,"" says Derichs. ""Shame and guilt often get in the way of learning how to apologize.""
She breaks it down into five main steps: (1) Expressing regret (""I'm sorry."" ""I feel badly about what I did.""); (2) Taking responsibility (""I was wrong. I'm sorry""); (3) Making amends (""I'm sorry. What can I do to make it right?""); (4) Showing remorse (""I'll try not to do that again.""); and (5) Asking for forgiveness are all ways in which you can learn to apologize.
This skill will take you far‚Äîespecially if you often drink with your boss.
6
How to Keep Romance Alive
By 40, you've had a few long-term relationships and seen how the burst of passion early on subsides over time. But you should also have learned that it's essential to put in the effort to keep the spark of excitement, spontaneity, and expressions of affection. Derichs recommends a few ""moves,"" each day: A 30-second hug, a 15-second kiss, even making sure you're showered, shaved, and wearing a nice outfit.
""You did all of that when you first where dating, don't stop now,"" says Derichs. ""Cook for your significant other or plan a date that is a complete surprise. Keep it simple ‚Äî surprise is essential to keep the romance and desire for one another alive."" And you should definitely be able to reel off the 13 Sexiest Things You Can Ever Say to a Woman.
7
How to Stay in Touch
The older you get, the more people have entered your life‚Äîfar too many for one person to keep in close contact. By your 40s you should have a handle on how to keep in touch with people in a way that keeps them in your orbit, but doesn't require a hefty time commitment. Set calendar reminders of friends' birthdays and anniversaries (you can use Facebook to help remind you, but shoot a text letting them know you are thinking of them, rather than a generic social media post). Get in the habit of sending out relevant articles or bits of news to connections who would find it interesting (but not mass email). Organize the occasional meet up of old colleagues or friends. And remember: making time for your buddies is essential not only for good health‚Äîbut also staying young.
8
How to Update Your R√©sum√©
In your early years in the workforce, you would update your r√©sum√© when you needed a new job. But not only has the world of recruitment changed (with LinkedIn allowing for anyone to check out your career history with a Google search) but you should have also learned that a r√©sum√© is something that is best updated frequently.
""When you delay keeping track of your accomplishments and various developments in your career, when you do need a r√©sum√© it will be a scramble to remember some of the important activities and milestones that are uniquely special and distinguish you from the mass of other folks in job search,"" says Roy Cohen, an executive coach and author of The Wall Street Professional's Survival Guide.
Another great corporate world skill? Knowing how to do a proper handshake.
9
How to Network
By 40, you've seen how valuable a personal network of like-minded, ambitious professionals is in helping you get a new job, promotion, or do your work better. You've also seen how much work building this network can be. You should know how to seek out places where those in similar professions will be (whether designated as ""networking events"" or simply places where others in your field gather) and be comfortable striking up conversations with strangers who could be responsible for your next big career move‚Äîand be sure to learn the rest of the 25 Ways the Smartest Men Get Ahead at Work.
10
How to Pitch and Interview
Just as with your r√©sum√©, you should have learned to convey who you are and what you do in a crisp, compelling way‚Äîand have figured out how to keep it fresh and relevant. ""It is not unusual for men in their 40s to lose track of who they are professionally,"" warns Cohen. ""They get on a treadmill and keep going with little time or commitment for reflection and insights. Men who are skilled at promoting themselves and their notable accomplishments land jobs faster.""
11
How to Buy Good Wine
Wine is an area where a little knowledge is hardly a dangerous thing. Don't let the pretentious wine experts or volumes written on terroir intimidate you. Just get the basics down: A few regions and the types of wine they make well (Chardonnay from Australia, Chianti Classico from Tuscany), general characteristics you like (dry, bold, full-bodied, fruity), and let the guy at the wine store or the server at the restaurant take it from there. If you're looking to stock up your cellar, here's How to Start a Wine Collection, by the World's No. 1 Wine Expert.
12
How to Cook at Least One Fancy Meal
You don't have to be Mario Batali in the kitchen, but you should have at least one impressive meal you know how to make. Tacos or pasta are fine for a random weeknight, but by 40 you should be able to make something that will dazzle a date or a dinner party: flavorful rosemary braised lamb shanks, perfectly cooked beef wellington, or something else that will have guests going ""whoa!""
""That special person in your life will appreciate this more than almost any other way of celebrating, saying you're sorry, or simply as the most awesome date ever that can practically guarantee getting laid,"" says Ken Immer, president and chief culinary officer of Culinary Health Solutions.
Bonus: here's how to Cook a Steak at Home Like a Pro.

How to Resolve a Conflict
Now that you're in your 40s, more often than not, you're the adult in the room. If you see an argument or fight breaking out (including ones you are part of), you should know how to defuse it and get to a place where all those involved feel heard‚Äîor at least aren't punching each other in the face. Derichs advises identifying the ""conflict management styles"" of those involved.
""When conflict arises the first step is to decide whether to address it or let it go,"" she says. ""Conflict avoiders focus needs to be 'what am willing to get into?' A conflict approachers focus is 'what I am willing to let go of?' A general rule is that if the issue is troublesome enough that it is affecting your behavior or weighing on your conscience, it should be addressed.""

Introducing Making It, a new column in which writer Sandy Yong aims to help young adults get their financial footing.
Being in your early 20s is full of exciting milestones, but it can also be a nerve-wracking time. With so much to learn?from choosing a career path to renting your first apartment?it?s not always easy to know if you?re making the correct choices, especially when it comes to your finances. You have to learn how to spend, save and invest your money, and to figure out which credit card to get or how to finance your education. And, if you?ve ever made mistakes with your money, it?s easy to feel like that one wrong move has thrown you off course for good.
Looking back, I made plenty of money mistakes along the way, too. The good news? I learned from them, which made me more confident in the way I handle my personal finances now. Here are six important money lessons I wish I knew when I was younger.
Reflecting back, it would have been wise to heavily research which types of jobs offered which salary ranges before beginning post-secondary education. Depending on your choice of degree, certificate or trade you could be on the road to a high-paying, in-demand job. However, you could spend time and money pursuing education in a particular field only to find out the industry offers low wages and poor job security. Interestingly, we are now witnessing an emerging trend where large companies such as Google and Apple no longer require you to have a degree to apply for a particular role, so it?s worth exploring those options as well.
It?s hard to believe, but you can actually talk your way into better pay. I implemented this strategy during my year-end performance review and I was able to receive a raise. A portion of this extra income was directed towards my registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) while treating myself to a nice celebration dinner.
Many Canadians don?t take advantage of this: According to a recent survey, just over one-third (36%) of Canadian workers negotiated a higher salary with their last job offer. This means there is money being left on the table. To take advantage of this opportunity, you can start by conducting industry research on current salary trends for your type of role. It?s important to show your boss that you know your facts along with how much value you bring to the table.
If your employer will not budge on your salary, you can negotiate other perks. Some of these include paid time off, extra vacation days, a flexible work schedule, better performance-related bonuses, stock options, health benefits, and even an education budget. The more prepared you are, the more confident you will be when you have this discussion with your boss.
A job loss, dental bills or car repairs are all expensive problems that can happen at a moment?s notice. An emergency fund helps you cover these expenses and avoid stress and debt. This happened to me last year when I underwent an unexpected root canal surgery. Fortunately, I had partial dental insurance coverage to help pay for the costs. However, I still had to dip into my emergency savings fund, which made a $1,700 dent.

According to Statistics Canada, 64% of Canadians have an emergency savings fund to cover three months? worth of expenses. If you are looking to build or boost your emergency savings fund, it?s recommended to have between three to six months of expenses saved up. You may even consider topping it up further if you are facing financial instability and you want to ensure you can make ends meet for a longer period of time.
A credit card is one way to build your credit history, which will be helpful down the road when you need to get approved for a loan or mortgage. Carrying a card comes with responsibilities. If you don?t pay off your credit card balance every month, it will harm your credit score and leave you in a snowball of debt.
Another temptation is to opt into the buy now, pay later (BNPL) payment plans that allow consumers to split their purchase into several smaller installments that are often interest-free. Even so, if you stack multiple purchases with this type of financing, the payments can add up. Instead, ensure that you have enough money in your bank account to pay off your monthly credit card balance in full so that you don?t incur hefty interest charges.
Take your time to research and find the best credit card for you. There are many types available, from one?s that earn cash back and travel points on everyday spending to pre-paid cards that give you flexibility without going into debt. Some require you to pay an annual fee, but you can opt-in for a no-fee credit card that provides decent perks.
Also, if you ever decide to cancel a credit card, it may negatively affect your credit score by increasing your credit utilization rate and shrinking your credit history. I wish I knew this before closing one of the credit cards that no longer served me, but that I had used to build a decade-long credit history. Luckily, I implemented other methods to build my credit history including paying off my student loans, making timely payments for my cell phone bills and automating my mortgage installments. An alternative method is to switch to a different card with your credit card provider. This allows you to continue enjoying the benefits of having a credit card while preserving your credit history.
In my mid-20s, I decided to take a summer trip to Europe with a tour group. I saved up $8,000 to visit 13 countries in a month, and I made lifelong friends. I had incredible experiences, such as going up the iconic Eiffel Tower, visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and taking a gondola ride in Venice. It was worth the money, and when I look back at the photos, it inspires me to plan my next trip with my family.
Turns out, my feelings track with the research: A study by the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, shows that people are happier when they spend their money on experiences rather than material things. Purchasing an item may give you in-the-moment happiness, but when you spend time with family to go on a vacation, it creates memories you can fondly look back on.
As tempting as it may be to keep up with your friends? purchases and lifestyle (or how it appears on social media), it can become a cycle that can make you miserable. Just when you feel like you have ?caught up,? they are already onto the next car, handbag or flatscreen. The next time you?re tempted to spend money, think of what you could do with that money if put toward experiences that matter to you, like seeing your favourite band with your friends or visiting that dream destination.

Having been raised in a modest household with immigrant parents, I learned to become mindful of how I spend my money. When I dated men who spent lavishly on their wardrobe or fancy cars, I knew striking a balance would be a challenge. Thankfully, my husband and I share similar values and we have common financial goals that we are working towards together.
If you?re in (or are looking for) a serious relationship, you want a partner who is financially compatible with you. If you have different mindsets for finances, finding a balance can still be achieved?it may just take more time and effort.
Having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend or girlfriend about money will help develop trust so that you both feel comfortable handling finances together. Come up with a plan to tackle any debt you may have and discuss what your financial goals are. You will also want to plan for the future. Whether it?s buying a home together or tying the knot, these are both big financial decisions that you will want to agree on sooner rather than later.

Most jobs these days require a general post secondary degree even to work in a call center. People don?t become doctors, corporate executives, managers, etc. with just a general BA and no experience.
Most corporate-world salary increases are based on performance and the company?s established salary ranges. So if you are a ?satisfactory? performer you get X and if you ?exceed expectations? you get more. Very few people below an managerial/executive level are able to ?negotiate? additional salary increases, benefits or perks.

Remember that your best qualities as well as your worst are hidden when you wear such types of clothes, and you could be missing out on an ideal opportunity to highlight your best assets.
Shapeless clothes to not really do anything to take away from the impression of bulk either, so you may as well wear properly tailored 35 womens clothing that can do something to flatter your figure.
Black isn‚??t necessarily the best option for 36 to 39 years old womens clothing either. Yes, we have all heard how darker colors make you look slimmer, but this isn‚??t always true, particularly for women that are decidedly on the heavy end of the scale.
There are various other factors that go into consideration when choosing mid 30 women‚??s clothing, and dark colors isn‚??t quite at the top of the list. More important factors to consider are proportion, proper tailoring, and over all design coordination. You could opt to wear 36 to 39 age women‚??s clothing in monochromatic tones for example, and they will certainly be more visually appealing than an all-black outfit.
If you are having trouble finding 36-39 years age women‚??s clothing in your local stores, you may want to try doing your shopping online.

"In this article, we are going to talk about 35 old women, who can wear amazing outfits, without being scared to look weird. Every woman has a unique style, no matter if she is in her 20‚??s or 30‚??s. Of course, you gonna feel a bit mature, once you hit 35.
But there is nothing to be scared of, all you need is to wear something more classy, that still looks impressive.
The thing about dressing for your age is silly. Why? No one should tell you what to wear, you know how to make things happen. But there are basic rules for older women that should not be avoided. First of all, sop wearing all those graphic tees, they are cool, but not for your age.
Beautiful Dresses For Older Women
A simple navy dress with tortoise rounded sunglasses and layered necklaces will be a good start for women over 30.
What I love about dresses, then it‚??s their versatility. You can be old, young or mature, but you can still wear a dress. If you need inspiration, then I highly recommend checking out my favorite ideas on lace dresses, I am sure everyone will find here something special. Bedazzled sequins and shiny tassels can be replaced with metallic items. No, I am not telling you to stop wearing your favorite sequined dress, but make sure it‚??s colored in a mature hue. Don‚??t go for neon shades, it‚??s stupid.
Office Style Inspired Outfits
Don‚??t be shy and wear office inspired looks. Here we see a good example, on how to combine a navy blazer with cream beige chinos and suede ankle boots.
Speaking of pink tops and bright red pants, then it‚??s another category that can be replaced with simple classy color pieces, like a white top and black pants. I am not saying you should stop wearing pink or red, just make sure it‚??s a complimentary color that underlines your personality.
Windowpane grey dress ideally suits older women, it makes them look elegant and sophisticated, complete this look with a pair of classy sassy pumps and a spacious handbag:
If we are talking about sparkling skinny jeans, mini skirts, cut-offs paired with crop tops, then I am 100% sure, it will make you look weird.
Black and white will never die. Go for a monochrome outfit by teaming a black blazer with a white sweater and black pants:
Of course, everything depends on your body type and how much anti-aging cream you are using (joke). You should never risk your comfort zone. If you are okay to wear skinnies, crop tops and nobody throws bad jokes on your back, then you are okay to go. You should always keep your outfit modern, classy and functional. I know many women who try to dress like real Parisian ladies, once they hit thirty.
How about teaming a black top with khaki green high-rise pants, a kind of military touch is felt in this combo:
Monochrome Trend Is Still Popular
Go for pastel cream-beige look and make it elegant and sophisticated. I do love once color outfit ideas.
Mix Casual With Dressy
You might wear girlish pieces, but be sure to complete them with edgy and casual pieces. Here we see a cargo jacket styled with a striped top and pleated skirt in blush.
A modern lady should always go for a look that is flattering, age-appropriate and trendy. Go for apparel that feels comfy and wears easily. You should always imagine how do you look from a side, if you do like it, then nobody should stop you from buying that or another thing. By the way, even dresses and sneakers outfit ideas look awesome on older women.
Cardigan Will Be Your Friend
I recommend 35 old women to try this long cardigan, a perfect choice for long casual street walks.
Another long cardigan in white color. It will be a perfect update and layering piece for your overall look:
Always try to experiment. We see a khaki desert cargo dress completed with stylish blush pumps:
If you start asking yourself, if you are okay to wear it, then don‚??t buy it. Below are gathered my favorite outfit ideas for women over 35. Each look was found in the streets of big cities, so you know for sure, everything works just fine!
You should always play fun. Go for a structured skirt suit and complete it with a cool bucket hat:
You can always have fun with contemporary and futuristic clothes, just make sure you are not overloading the look. By the way, a black biker jacket with a grey dress and cool kicks is a good alternative for casual errands:
35 Old Women Try To Combine Classics With Modern
No matter what is your age, you can still look ladylike, elegant, or any like you want. Once you hit 35, you psychically start to think differently, more mature. Below are gathered impressive street style looks and ideas that perfectly suit ladies who want to make a standout appearance, but still, look appropriate.
Women Over 30 Should Try Different Shapes And Silhouettes
I know many ladies who try to combine different shapes and silhouettes. This simple tip can easily make you look special at any place and time. I do love to see women who wear wide-leg pants in different ways. It makes me think of the seventies style comeback.
No woman can live without a dress, just make sure to choose the appropriate style and length:
I know many women in their 40 who manage to wear contemporary clothes without looking out of place. Yes, thirty-five and forty old women do look the same, that‚??s why I am thinking of making a post on women over 40 style ideas, as I have lots of inspiring looks to share with you.
White Blouse And Black Pants Are Classics
A white top and black pants is a safe combo, be sure to complete it with some fancy accessories and details.
Oversized and baggy clothing is another trend for 35 old women, you can always play with your shape, just make sure you do it right:
Don‚??t Be Shy To Try Athleisure
If you do like to take risks, then how about adding a sporty touch? Go for joggers or athleisure style track pants and style them with classic tops.
What you need is to start caring about yourself the way you are, in other words, love yourself and your body and the way you look. By the way, you can still wear skirts, this garment will be a great choice teaming with knits. I made a post on ways how to wear skirts with sweaters, check it out, you gonna find incredible combos that are easy to style in real life.
Bonus Tips On What To Wear When You Are Over 30:
Dark-Wash Jeans For Women Over 30
A pair of dark-wash jeans are a great investment for women over 30. They are versatile, so you are free to wear them with casual, as well as with dressy garments, for work and leisure.

Buy Neutral Color Silk Blouse

Silhouette-Flattering Black Blazer For Women Over 35
My personal must-have for women over 35 is a black blazer in silhouette-flattering design. Style it with a white top and black skinny jeans:
Buy Cashmere Crew-Neck Sweaters
Cashmere sweaters are great for those who like to wear classics and keep it for a long period. Here we see a maroon cashmere sweater tucked in high-waisted pencil beige skirt:
Polished White T-shirts For Women Over 35
If you are into basics, then go for this white T-shirt. Complete the look by adding slim cream-grey pants and tortoise cat-eye shades:
Invest In Classic Trench Coat
Outerwear is another topic. Here we see a must-have classic beige trench-coat that can be used for casual and formal events. Layer it over a blue dress and complete the look by adding nude pointed-toe caged pumps embellished with studs:
Buy Classic Leather Belt
Any outfit should be completed with accessories. A belt is a useful accessory, so you better buy the classic one. Here we see a cream-white sweater tucked in blue jeans completed with a classic black leather belt:
Choose Flattering Pair Of Sunglasses
During sunny weather days, you can also update your look with a pair of flattering pair of sunglasses. Here we see Wayfarer sunglasses worn with a red buttoned shirtdress:
Invest In Polished Classic Bag
My favorite accessory for women over 35 is a classic polished bag. Invest in a luxe bag, so everyone knows that you are a very special lady. Here we see a classic black leather handbag worn with a white turtleneck and dark green slipdress:
Classic Black Pumps For Women Over 35
If you want to keep things classy and ladylike, then go for classic black pumps, they always look good on women over 35. Here we see a pair of black heeled pumps styled with black tights, Houndstooth print slim dress and a black turtleneck is worn under it:
Simple White Sneakers For Women Over 30
Another great choice for casual and sporty weekends is a pair of simple white sneakers. Here we see a white sweatshirt teamed with black leggings and white sneakers:
Invest In A Classic Little Black Dress

Go For Blouses, Instead Of Shirts
Make a statement by wearing a classy blouse and get rid of the shirts. Here we see a rich green silken blouse tucked in black high-waisted jeans:
High Waisted Jeans For Women Over 35
Stay away from low-rise jeans and go for high-waisted jeans. We see ankle-length light blue high-rise mom jeans style,d with a grey pullover, camel fedora hat, and brown ankle-boots:
Ankle Length Pants For The Office
If you work in the office, then go for ankle-length pants. Here we see a good example, the lady is wearing a white sweater tucked in khaki green wide-leg ankle-length pants completed with ankle-cuff heeled sandals in black and Wayfarer sunglasses:
What You Should Not Wear:
Low Rise Jeans, Jeggings, Vibrant Print Jackets and Suits, Mary Janes, funky sneakers, tube tops, crop tops, mini skirts, leather mini skirts, bodycon dresses, college outfits, rompers, playsuits, cut-offs.
Sure thing, everything is individual. I can‚??t say for sure that once you hit 35, all your older clothes should be changed, but the basic rules remain the same, invest in classics and try to avoid all those college and youthful bright print items. Go for comfortable outfits and complete them with your favorite accessories and jewelry. Dig it? Believe me, dressing for your age might be tricky sometimes, but the result is going to be unforgettable. What about you, what do you wear when you‚??re 35

"Looking for some guidance on how to assemble the right wardrobe to dress well in your 40‚??s? Take a look at our top 30 tips on what to wear and how to put together the best outfits in your 40‚??s!
When you stock your closet with items that fit well and that you feel confident, comfortable, and beautiful in, you‚??re off to a good start!
You don‚??t have to break the bank for every item, but if there is an article of clothing that you know you will wear again and again, it‚??s ok to splurge and get something high-quality and long-lasting.
Find a pair of women's jeans that doesn't have rips ‚?? you‚??ll look much more put together and dignified this way.
You can tell when you‚??re looking at a piece of clothing made with cheap material, so opt for high-quality fabrics for an overall more polished look.
While the preferred skirt length varies from person to person, most women are going to look best in women's skirts that hit their knee or below.
Having a high quality, classic women's coat, such as a trench coat or peacoat, will prove to work well with any ensemble you put together, in addition to keeping you warm in the winter.
No matter your age, everyone looks good in a classic women's white blouse or tee. Whether paired with your favorite jeans or tucked into a skirt, this is a wardrobe item you won‚??t want to skip out on.
You‚??d be surprised by how many women are wearing the wrong size bra, as well as how much better you will look when your bra fits well. Get fitted and invest in the right size bra.
Your jewelry should be minimal ‚?? too many items will look too busy and distract instead of enhance. Be intentional about which jewelry you choose to incorporate.
For items that are meant to be more form-fitting, take the time to make sure you get the right fit. Take special care with jeans, pencil skirts, and blouses.
There are few things worse than a dingy, yellowed white article of clothing. Keep your whites white and looking fresh.
Unsure of which direction to go with your jeans? Choosing dark denim will prove to be both versatile and very flattering!
Make sure you have a handful of statement pieces available in your wardrobe ‚?? from bold colors to lively prints, you‚??ll be happy to have them!
Make sure your outfits are balanced well. For example, a flowy women's blouse pairs beautifully with a fitted skirt. However, it might look a bit sloppy if paired with baggy pants.
One key to looking put together is ensuring that your women's shoes are up to date. Staying in style and keeping your shoes in good condition is a must.
Having some little black dresses is a wardrobe must for women of every age. Be sure to keep one (or two or three) on hand.
As we mentioned earlier with skirt length, it‚??s important to understand what you‚??re most comfortable with and which skirt and dress length work best for your body type. Do some experimenting to see what you like best.
Experiment with your women's accessories! Throwing on a scarf and belt can take an average outfit and make it extraordinary.
Perhaps it was great in college or handy when you were a young mom, but it‚??s time to say goodbye to cargo. There are plenty of other pieces to focus on that will work much better for you.
One pant style that you will want to consider is a wide-leg trouser. They‚??re comfortable and can do wonders for lengthening your legs and making you look tall and trim.
Incorporating bold colors into your wardrobe is a great way to easily throw together outfits that help you feel confident ‚?? bright reds, yellows, and blues are a great place to start.
Stock up on a good assortment of women's sweaters and cardigans. These make for adorable and comfortable cold-weather ensembles.
Having an assortment of purses and bags is fun, but having one neutral, good-sized purse that is easy to pair with any outfit is definitely a must.
Don‚??t be afraid to mix and match a bit. You run the risk of looking too matchy-matchy when wearing gray on gray or navy on navy.
Make sure you have a healthy assortment of neutral pieces in your wardrobe. Black, white, and nude is easy to pair with almost any other color, giving you endless outfit options.
Whether pants or skirts, items featuring a high waist are sure to be both comfortable and flattering, and easy to pair with your shirts and blouses.
The key to finding the right heel height is comfort. Going with a heel that is too high can leave you wishing you‚??d chosen otherwise, so invest in heels that are versatile and comfortable!
Staying on top of color trends is an easy way to keep your wardrobe fresh and up to date. Make sure you know which color is most popular for the season and get a handful of items in that hue.
Don‚??t feel like you have to stick to solid colors ‚?? patterns and prints are an easy way to add variety for easily assembled outfits.
At the end of the day, the most important thing is that you are able to express your individual sense of style through your wardrobe. Stock up on the women's clothing that helps you feel confident and beautiful and you will be good to go!",female
"You‚??ve made it to your fourth decade, and fashion-wise, you‚??re in a pretty great place. You‚??ve likely got your personal style down pat, so now it‚??s just about making styling decisions that ensure you‚??re never looking less than 100 (percent, not years old). Here, nine tips to keep in mind every time you get dressed.
The 9 Best Fashion Tips for Women Over 40
1. Don't Give Up On Heels
It can be mighty tempting to eschew stilettos in favor of flats and sneakers or worse...garden shoes. But know that there is a middle ground: Sensible heels that are as easy to walk in as they are stylish. A two- or three-inch style (we love a simple slingback) is surprisingly comfortable and looks put together, and won't leave you with sore soles and aching arches.
Get the look: Kurt Geiger ($120; $78); Karl Lagerfeld Paris ($99); Zou Xou ($220); Brother Vellies ($465; $326)
2. Show off Your Clavicle Instead Of Your Cleavage
A plunging V-neck was great in your twenties, but you‚??re older and wiser now. Instead of strapping on your best push-up bra, highlight your clavicle with off-the-shoulder or boat neck silhouettes. It‚??s super sophisticated and sexy, without being buttoned-up or vampy.
Get the look: Universal Standard ($55); Treasure & Bond ($69); Ted Baker London ($99) Majorelle ($148)
3. Go For Mid-length Sleeves
Real talk: Shirts that show off your slender forearms are flattering as hell (regardless of your age). If your top was made with cropped sleeves, great. If you‚??re wearing a button-down or other long-sleeved piece, roll ‚??em up.
Get the look: Topshop ($58; $29); Dolan Left Coast ($88; $71); Vince Camuto ($99); Acne Studios ($170)
4. Invest In Accessories
You‚??re a grown woman. That means you deserve a bag that A) you won't be embarrassed to carry around and B) will warrant at least two compliments every time you do. You‚??ll never regret purchasing a timeless style, especially one that gets better with age (oh, hello, naturally worn-in leather).
Get the look: Demellier ($480); Prada ($990); Gucci ($1,852); Saint Laurent ($2,290)
5. Opt For Darker Wash Denim
Here's a fact: Dark wash denim is inherently slimming. Plus, since they‚??re closer to a black or navy, they‚??re more adult and easier to dress up than bleached washes. Shy away from excessive fading or distressing, for the most age-appropriate take on jeans.
Get the look: Good American ($165); Paige ($179); AG ($198; $159); Goldsign ($295)
6. Pick solids Over Prints
No, we‚??re not saying you should toss every floral piece in your closet, but in general, it‚??s way simpler to look elegant and appropriate in a neutral solid. Outfits in solid beige, white, brown, navy and black are easier to accessorize and re-wear in multiple ways.

7. Find A Good Tailor
Now that you know what looks great on your shape, find someone you trust to take your wardrobe to the next level. Hemming a pair of pants or blazer by even half an inch could make all the difference.

8. Treat Yourself To Quality Pieces You'll Wear Forever
Chasing trends is just fine, but make sure to pad your wardrobe with quality basics that are a sound investment. The high-quality fabric and fabrication mean you'll have these pieces for years to come. Just make sure to seek out silhouettes and colors that feel timeless (skip the prints here, too), so you'll actually want to wear these items season after season.

9. Go For The Gold (jewelry)
Ditch costume jewelry and toss your stacks of tarnished rings. Level up with a tasteful display of gold jewelry‚??all pieces that are as real as you. But you don't have to break the bank with your new, upgraded taste in rings, bracelets and necklaces. Look for direct-to-consumer find jewelry brands, like Mejuri or The Last Line, both known for producing high-quality baubles at prices you can afford.",female
"Of course you can dress any which way you like. But i know that some of you worry that you look too young, or you feel that you may be trying too hard to stay young. I‚??ve also been getting questions on how to avoid appearing older than you are. So here are some of my guidelines on how to dress after 40.
Please note that these are just GENERAL guidelines and some of my own personal preferences. They certainly don‚??t apply to everyone.
However, I do believe in dressing to your strengths and taking your body shape and style personality into account. So, if you would like to have some guidelines on how to dress after 40, then you can find them below.
HOW TO DRESS AFTER 40 ‚?? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SHOULD AVOID?
Below are a few general guidelines on what to avoid doing in terms of style after 40, style over 50 or any age above.
1. DON‚??T BUY CLOTHES THAT DO NOT FLATTER YOU, EVEN IF THEY ARE ON TREND THIS SEASON.
You may be tempted by a new trend but, when thinking about how to dress after 40, it‚??s wise to be picky. Only choose those that suit your personality and your your body type. You can find guides on dressing all the different body types in these articles:
2. TRY NOT TO BE TOO MATCHY-MATCHY OR TOO POLISHED
It‚??s nice to mix things up and be a bit more playful. A 2-piece suit will quickly look old. Better to mix that jacket with another skirt or pants and look effortlessly chic.
Melinda (above) chooses to pair an on-trend oversized blazer with her black pencil skirt, and mixing formal and casual by wearing with sneakers.
Check out this similar blouse, blazer, skirt, sneakers, clutch and sunglasses.
3. AVOID BUYING FABRICS THAT LOOK CHEAP (OR ARE CHEAP AND POORLY MADE) AS THEY ARE USUALLY NOT FLATTERING OR WILL NOT LAST
As a young woman, you may have looked cute in a flimsy, poorly made t-shirt but as a woman over 40, you need something with a bit more substance.
You can see some characteristics of fabrics here. We also have a list of recommended shops here. Best to buy only the clothes that you love and that have a chance to last.
Look for beautiful natural fabrics like silk, cotton, linen and cashmere and you will enjoy them for years to come. Think about your purchase in terms of cost per wear rather than initial price.
Avoid fabrics that don‚??t drape well or cling.

4. WEARING TIGHT AND TIGHT TOGETHER
Of course there are many exceptions but in general tighter items like leggings look better when they are combined with wide pieces like a tunic or wider shirt.
That also applies to skirts. Aim to have either a tight skirt with a loser top or vice versa.
Jacqueline (above) opts for a tunic-style top with her leggings.

DRESSING OVER 40: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SHOULD DO MORE OF?
1. KNOW YOUR STYLE!
Nothing is more important than dressing in a way that pleases and represents you. There‚??s no such thing as one style of ‚??fashion for older women‚?ù that suits everyone.
If you know your style and understand your body you can break any of the rules or add items from the ‚??don‚??t list‚?? as you please. My style guide will help with that.
Doing our style personality quiz will also give you a better idea of your style.
Kim (above) is arguably breaking some of the ‚??rules‚?ù of dressing. For example, she wears a loose top over a loose skirt. However, she still looks absolutely incredible, particularly with the addition of a pair of edgy boots ‚?? proof that you should stick to your style and not be afraid to experiment.
Check out this metallic top and skirt that you can wear with this similar pair of boots, sling bag and hoop earrings.
2. DETERMINE THE WARDROBE ESSENTIALS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOUR STYLE.
Not everyone will have the same wardrobe essentials. This will depend on your lifestyle and your style personality.
But having a collection of wardrobe essentials in your closet will make dressing every day so much easier ‚?? and more stylish.
Personally, I love to have plenty of asymmetrical items in my closet.
3. HAVE MORE LASTING HIGH QUALITY ITEMS IN YOUR WARDROBE.
These vary for each style personality but some important classics are:
- A white button down shirt. Check our tips on how to wear a white shirt
- A long coat (could be a trench coat). Check out tips on how to choose a coat.
- A beautiful dress that fits you perfectly. Don‚??t automatically go for a little black dress. Many women over 40 will actually look better (and slimmer) in a colorful dress. ‚?? you may like to get a dress with sleeves
- Well fitted long pants. Check out what shoes to wear with different styles of pants
- A well fitted blazer.
- A good pair of dark denim jeans that fit you well. Boot cut or straight leg is usually the most flattering style. Check all our tips on wearings jeans.

5. LOOK EFFORTLESSLY CHIC
Take a good critical look at yourself before you go out and see if you look too overdone. When thinking about fashion at 50, over 40 or any age above, the aim is to look effortlessly chic so just evaluate and if necessary you may have to add on something a bit more casual.
Sally (above) wears an understated, but stylish outfit. She sticks to a palette of neutrals, but adds interest with her see-through block heels and on-trend ruched bag.

6. Don‚??t neglect your casual wardrobe
It‚??s easy to be attracted to evening wear on the store rails or online. However, it‚??s likely that you will actually wear your casual outfits much more.
So, don‚??t neglect your day-to-day wardrobe. You could choose a drapey cardigan to add style and warmth to a simple jeans and t-shirt outfit. Or add a blazer to casual wear to elevate your look.

7. MIX YOUR OWN STYLE WITH A TREND YOU LIKE
Keep updated with the fashion trends and make sure you have a few current items in your wardrobe. For the best style over 40, only pick those trends that work for you!
8. CHOOSE A SKIRT OR DRESS LENGTH THAT‚??S RIGHT FOR YOU
For many women dresses and skirts that are just above or on top of the knee are a great length for women over 40. Right now longer dresses are very much on trend as well and can be a great style for older women to choose.
Petite women may want to go a bit shorter with their skirt lengths to get the 1/3 ‚?? 2/3 silhoutte. Find out more about this rule of thirds in our article on how to wear capris.
Monika (above) shows how flattering a skirt that is just below the knee can be.

Make sure to choose shoes that you are able to walk in. Mid high heels can look fabulous.
If you need more support I have a great list of arch support shoes.

10. Invest in a great pair of flattering jeans
Your jeans can be the mainstay of your closet as they go with so many other things, and can be dressed up or down.
Opt for a style which flatters your figure rather than the latest on-trend jeans shape.

12. OPTIONAL: USE SHAPEWEAR
If you want to hide some of the bulges, then shapewear definitely helps. I personally only wear it on special occasions.
If you don‚??t like shapewear, then learning how to skilfully hide with the right clothes will be preferable, like these tips in my article on how to hide your belly.

13. WEAR A GOOD BRA
Make sure you wear a good bra and invisible undergarments. A great bra will make sure that there is clear distance between your chest and your tummy!

14. WEAR WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL AMAZING
The most important style ‚??rule‚?ù of all is to wear what makes you feel confident. That way, you‚??ll have a spring in your step and you‚??ll be ready for whatever the day brings.
Check out this similar dress, sandals, necklace and sunglasses to recreate my look.
WEAR WHAT FEELS RIGHT TO YOU!
I want to emphasize again that these tips are not set in stone and it‚??s up to you to decide what works best for you. But if you want to look young and hip, then these guidelines can certainly help.
The more you understand your body and your style, the more you can break these rules as you please.

"You've met with and moved forward from the big 4-0. You're all grown up. It's time to make some fashion changes that reflect your maturity.
Mature doesn't mean old, of course. It's vibrant, powerful and dignified. In our fitness conscious society, it's possible you look as good now as you did when you were 20. Still, the flirty, skin-revealing fashions from the junior department don't really suit you, even if they still fit.

Sure, your body's changed with time. But the need for a new style runs deeper than how clothes fit your mature curves. It's not enough anymore to get noticed. You've got to connect intellectually. You need to be taken seriously, appreciated for your accomplishments and respected for your experience.
For this to happen, you need to look the part from head to toe. See where to start on the next page.
